Welcome to my (small) github page!

It is splitted into 2 parts:

- First, electronics/programming project presentations (no code here):
	- End to End low pass filter board for audio signal:
		keywords: signal processing (analog filtering, digital filtering), ADC, PWM, PIC
	- Analog audio amplifier based on integrated chips:
		keywords: analog amplifier, PCB layout

- Then, a huffman entropy coding python demo code to compress text file


Don't hesitate ask questions about those personal projects.
